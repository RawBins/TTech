Like Naruto and Boruto, Minato have blonde hair and blue eyes.
 He is tall and is shown to wear the Hidden Leaf Village flak jacket along with a white robe with the Kanji of "Fourth Hokage' written on the back.
  After his reincarnation with Orochimaru's Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation jutsu, the sclera of his eyes turned from white to black and his body had cracks around his body.

  Personality
Minato was a respectful and a friendly man.
 He was willing to defend the Hidden Leaf Village from multiple threats such as the Third Great Ninja War and the Nine-Tailed Demon Attack on the Hidden Leaf Village.
 He was shown to deeply care for Kushina and was willing to protect her from the Hidden Clouds Ninjas.
  When a threat to a village like Tobi appears, Minato was willing to take his enemies very seriously.
 He also shows care for his son, Naruto, and entrusts him with helping the village.
